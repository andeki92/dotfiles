# Web Research Integration

## Purpose

This rule provides guidelines for leveraging web search and content fetching to ensure dotfiles configurations follow current best practices.

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Web Research

- When evaluating configuration options for tools or applications
- When troubleshooting compatibility issues between platforms
- When needing to understand newer features of tools in our stack
- Before implementing any major structural changes to the dotfiles

### Research Process

1. **Search for Current Best Practices**
   ```
   web_search "latest <tool> configuration best practices"
   web_search "<tool> dotfiles XDG compliance"
   web_search "<tool> macOS vs Linux configuration differences"
   ```

2. **Fetch Specific Resources**
   ```
   mcp_fetch_fetch {url: "https://relevant-documentation.com/page"}
   ```

3. **Analyze Findings**
   - Compare multiple sources
   - Consider the recency of information
   - Evaluate compatibility with our multi-platform approach

## Example Workflow

For updating Zsh configuration:

1. Search for current best practices:
   ```
   web_search "zsh configuration best practices 2023"
   ```

2. Check for XDG compliance guidelines:
   ```
   web_search "zsh XDG Base Directory support"
   ```

3. Fetch specific documentation if needed:
   ```
   mcp_fetch_fetch {url: "https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit#xdg-base-directory-support"}
   ```

4. Apply findings to our modular structure
