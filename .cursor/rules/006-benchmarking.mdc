# Zsh Startup Benchmarking

## Purpose

Measure zsh startup time to ensure configuration changes don't negatively impact performance.

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Run a benchmark
./scripts/benchmark.sh

# Run and save the results
./scripts/benchmark.sh --save
```

## Benchmark Results

The script runs multiple tests and calculates an average:

```
‚è±Ô∏è  Measuring zsh startup time
===========================
Running 5 tests...
  Test 1: 0.131s
  Test 2: 0.128s
  Test 3: 0.126s
  Test 4: 0.130s
  Test 5: 0.129s

üîç Results:
  Date: 2025-04-28
  Average startup time: 0.129s
  Compared to last: 0.024s faster ‚úÖ
```

## Recording History

With the `--save` option, results are added to `docs/benchmarks.md`:

```markdown
# Zsh Startup Benchmarks

| Date | Description | Time |
|---|----|---|
| 2025-04-25 | Initial configuration | 0.153s |
| 2025-04-28 | After cleanup | 0.129s |
```

## When to Benchmark

Run benchmarks:

1. Before making significant zsh configuration changes (establish baseline)
2. After making changes (measure impact)
3. Periodically to track performance over time

## Best Practices

- Run benchmarks multiple times for consistency
- Always add descriptive comments when saving benchmarks
- Be mindful of other processes that might affect results
- Document significant improvements or regressions in commit messages
